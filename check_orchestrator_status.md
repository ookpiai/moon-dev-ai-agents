# POLYMARKET SYSTEM STATUS

## 1. Data Collection ✅ ACTIVE

**Status**: Running in background
**Current Progress**: 
- 3,214+ market snapshots collected
- 15,637+ order book snapshots
- 20 markets being tracked
- Collecting data every 60 seconds
- News feeds being monitored (Reuters, BBC, Politico, NYT)

**How it works**:
1. Fetches 20 active markets from Polymarket API every minute
2. Records current prices, volume, liquidity for each market
3. Captures order book depth (bids/asks)
4. Monitors RSS news feeds for market-moving events
5. Stores all data in CSV files for meta-learning training

**Data Storage**:
- `src/data/polymarket/training_data/market_snapshots.csv`
- `src/data/polymarket/training_data/orderbook_snapshots.csv`
- `src/data/polymarket/training_data/event_snapshots.csv`

## 2. Paper Trading Orchestrator ⏸️ NOT RUNNING YET

**Status**: Multiple orchestrators attempted to start but hit initialization issues

**Why Not Running**:
The orchestrators are stuck in model initialization phase and haven't reached the main trading loop yet. They need to:
1. ✅ Load ModelFactory (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek) - DONE
2. 🔄 Initialize all 10 Polymarket agents - IN PROGRESS
3. ⏸️ Start main analysis loop - NOT REACHED YET

**What Paper Trading Does (When Running)**:
The orchestrator runs a continuous loop that:

### Phase 1: SENSE (Data Gathering)
- **Whale Flow Agent**: Tracks large bets from successful wallets
- **Event Catalyst Agent**: Monitors news for market-moving events
- **Anomaly Agent**: Detects unusual price/volume patterns

### Phase 2: THINK (AI Forecasting)
- **Swarm Forecaster**: 4 AI models predict probability in parallel
  - Claude: Deep reasoning
  - OpenAI: Balanced analysis
  - Gemini: Fast inference
  - DeepSeek: Alternative perspective
- **LLM Forecaster**: Adjusts market probability using learned weights

### Phase 3: DECIDE (Entry Gates)
- **Quant Layer**: Checks 6 entry conditions (ALL must pass):
  1. EV_net ≥ 3%
  2. Z-score ≥ 1.5
  3. Spread ≤ 6%
  4. Liquidity ≥ $10,000
  5. No conflicting signals
  6. Kelly sizing > minimum

### Phase 4: TRADE (Virtual Execution)
- Places virtual limit orders at fair value
- Tracks $10,000 paper trading portfolio
- Records entry price, size, timestamp

### Phase 5: EXIT (Position Management)
Checks 6 exit rules every cycle (ANY can trigger exit):
1. **EV Decay**: EV_net drops below 1%
2. **Z-Reversion**: Z-score < 0.8
3. **Trailing EV**: Current EV < 70% of peak
4. **Time Gate**: No 30%+ improvement in 7 days
5. **Signal Reversal**: ≥3 agents flip direction
6. **Profit/Stop**: Hit +8% profit or -3% stop loss

### Position Tracking
When running, positions are saved to:
- `src/data/polymarket/positions/open_positions.csv`
- `src/data/polymarket/positions/closed_positions.csv`

## 3. How to Start Paper Trading Properly

The orchestrator is too heavyweight to run continuously in background. Instead, run it on-demand:

```bash
# Option 1: Run orchestrator once to analyze current markets
python src/agents/polymarket_orchestrator.py

# Option 2: Run in continuous mode (checks markets every 5 minutes)
# This is the intended usage but requires stable system
python src/agents/polymarket_orchestrator.py --continuous

# Option 3: Test with a specific market
python src/agents/polymarket_orchestrator.py --market "Fed rate hike"
```

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Keep data collector running 24/7 (lightweight, currently working)
2. Run orchestrator manually when you want to check for opportunities
3. Or schedule it to run every few hours via cron/Task Scheduler

## Summary

✅ **Data Collection**: Working perfectly, running 24/7
⏸️ **Paper Trading**: Not currently running (initialization issues)
✅ **Meta-Learning**: Trained and ready (calibration.json exists)

**The system is collecting training data continuously, which is the most important part right now!**

As you collect more data over the next week, the meta-learner will have better patterns to learn from, making the paper trading more effective when you do run it.
